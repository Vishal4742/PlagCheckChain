## 📌 Project Description

PlagCheckChain is a decentralized solution that enables students to submit code assignments in a tamper-proof and transparent way. It stores cryptographic hashes of code submissions on the blockchain to detect duplicates and prevent plagiarism.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

To promote academic integrity and transparency by:
- Ensuring code originality among students
- Enabling instructors to verify code ownership using blockchain timestamps
- Creating an open, auditable submission log

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- ✅ Submit hashed code with assignment name
- 🔍 Detect duplicate submissions via `checkIfDuplicate()`
- 🕒 Timestamped records for submission validation
- 🔐 Immutable and transparent logs stored on-chain

---

## 🔮 Future Scope

- 🔗 IPFS integration to optionally store actual code
- 📊 Admin panel for real-time plagiarism alerts
- 🧠 AI-based similarity scoring on frontend
- 🎓 Faculty-only dashboard to filter students

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

1. Student A submits code `"print('Hello')"` for Assignment 1 → hash stored
2. Student B tries submitting same code → flagged as duplicate
3. Instructor reviews timestamp and student address to decide action
